**TLDR:** [One sentence restating the investigation question.] [One-two sentences summarizing the answer/conclusion.] [Confidence level and key limitation.]

<!--
Example TLDR:
"Question: Why aren't worker agents running tests? Answer: Agents follow documentation literally but test-running guidance isn't in spawn prompts or CLAUDE.md, only buried in separate docs. High confidence (85%) - validated across 5 agent sessions but small sample size."

Guidelines:
- Keep to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Answer: What question? What's the answer? How confident?
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

## Confidence Assessment

**Current Confidence:** [Level] ([Percentage])

**Why this level?**

[Explanation of why you chose this confidence level - what evidence supports it, what's strong vs uncertain]

**What's certain:**

- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]
- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]
- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]

**What's uncertain:**

- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]
- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]
- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]

**What would increase confidence to [next level]:**

- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]
- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]
- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]

**Confidence levels guide:**
- **Very High (95%+):** Strong evidence, minimal uncertainty, unlikely to change
- **High (80-94%):** Solid evidence, minor uncertainties, confident to act
- **Medium (60-79%):** Reasonable evidence, notable gaps, validate before major commitment
- **Low (40-59%):** Limited evidence, high uncertainty, proceed with caution
- **Very Low (<40%):** Highly speculative, more investigation needed
